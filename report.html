          structure did you choose to implement?

        <!-- Answer to the question -->
        <article class="article-content">
          <p>
            The chief purpose of my site is to provide the latest news about
            technological improvements in different sectors of computer science
            to its readers. The site supplies its users with info about sectors
            such as web development, artificial intelligence, game development,
            and app development. The target audience here are students and
            working professionals who want to stay updated on the go.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the site is acting as an online news magazine for people in a
            fast-paced world, it is crucial that the user is able to get the
            most information they can in one glance. To achieve this goal, I
            have portrayed the information in the form of nicely organized
            tiles. This allows me to pack a lot of information in a small screen
            area while maintaining a look that pleases the eye. I have also
            tried to keep the design of the site as minimal as possible with
            nearly no use of any fancy colors (just a combination of white and
            grey). This helps in making the site look modern and gives it a
            unique aesthetic while being easy to look at. It also is perfect for
            people with color blindness. This added simplicity also makes the
            site easy to navigate which in turn helps in creating a good user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site begins with a navigation bar that has a very modern,
            minimal, and simple design. It features a logo in the beginning and
            then displays links guiding you to different pages containing
            content targeted to different fields in computer science. This can
            then adapt to different screen sizes so that users who are trying to
            watch content on a tablet or a phone are not ignored. As you may
            notice, the navigation bar is not a sticky one that follows you
            throughout the scrolling. This is done intentionally to reduce the
            clutter and make the site look minimal. This also provides the user
            a screen that has more content than having unnecessary litter
            filling the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below the navigation bar comes the main content of the page. It
            starts with a big heading informing the user about the field of
            computer science the page targets. This helps make the user aware of
            what they are reading at all times. Below the main heading, you will
            find two sections of articles. To give them a slight separation and
            to make the site look a little cleaner, I have added a slight fading
            shade of grey as the background. Taking a look at the left section,
            you will be greeted with a big headline followed by smaller
            sub-headline articles. This makes the most important news stick out
            which helps guide the user to things that are the most important.
            With the world growing faster than ever before, advancements can be
            seen happening every second. To make the readers aware of the most
            recent activities in the industry in no time, I have added the
            latest article section showcasing the latest activities happening in
            the sector. This provides the user with the most recent news
            uplifting their knowledge whilst making them up to date with the
            industry. As I understand that knowing about the latest advancements
            in tech is as important as knowing about the biggest ones, I have
            added the latest article section on the right to the main articles.
            This way, the reader doesn’t have to compromise on anything and has
            access to both the biggest news and the latest news without the need
            for any scrolling.
          </p>
          <p>
            To let busy users get through their daily news without any
            bottlenecks, I have tried to use as little time-consuming animation
            as possible. The only animations that are evident are used to inform
            the user of any potential links they might have encountered. For eg,
            the zoom effect when hovering over images or quick text color
            changes when hovering over texts. This allows me to provide a site
            that has a decent level of aesthetics while not disrupting the user
            in any manner, making the experience pleasing and quick at the same
            time. When scrolling through the site, you may notice a small button
            with an arrow on the bottom right side of the page. This allows the
            user to get back on top without any additional scrolling making the
            process of navigating to the top swift and efficient. To free the
            user with a plethora of irritating pop-ups which have become a norm
            these days, I have tried to slim the number down to just one. The
            only pop-up I have is to inform the user of the weekly newsletter I
            provide and ask if they would like to subscribe. The pop-up will
            only be shown to the user the first time they visit the site which
            helps maintain the minimalism and ease of use the site is trying to
            achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scrolling to the bottom, you will find a footer that contains all
            the additional links and information about the page that you might
            be interested in. This includes pages that tell you more about the
            site as well as contact details. The footer also contains alternate
            links to the pages that talk about their own niche sub-topics of
            computer science. This will make locating pages way easier and will
            also be great for people who have already read everything on the
            current page.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a closer inspection, you will find that every page has a similar
            layout. This helps in navigation for new users as a person who has
            been through one page feels like home when navigating through other
            pages. It also makes browsing through articles is a piece of cake
            for the avid readers of TPM.

          State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.
        </h2>
        <h4 class="article-sub-title">
          These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists,
          developers etc.

        <!-- Answer to the question -->
        <article class="article-content">
          <h5>
            The lack of clutter-free online news magazines available on the
            internet
          </h5>
          <p class="indented">
            These days, browsing the internet for the latest updates cannot be
            imagined without irritating speed breakers. This can be in the form
            of pop-ups or cluttered content thrown in a disorganized and
            overdone layout. This issue is the reason I was motivated to make
            this website.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>The aesthetics modern minimal designing</h5>
          <p class="indented">
            It has been quite evident that the world is shifting towards
            simplicity and minimal design is the new trend. Being a fan of
            oversimplified minimal design myself, I was inspired to add this
            touch to a tech magazine as well.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>The design language of Analytics India Magazine</h5>
          <p class="indented">
            During my research, I discovered the website of analytics India
            Magazine:
            <a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/"
              >https://analyticsindiamag.com/</a
            >. Although it had its own flaws (a cluttered design while not being
            responsive enough), I was inspired by the design aesthetics of the
            website and slight similarities can be noticed when comparing the
            Analytics India Magazine and TPM side by side.

          <h5>Learn how to use CSS Grid</h5>
          <p class="indented">
            As CSS grid allows you to organise the content in an extremely easy
            manners, I knew that learning it was crucial to making my website. I
            also started with CSS Grid because while doing my research for the
            website, I learn’t that CSS grid is better when dealing with 2
            dimensions compaired to flexbox. To learn it, I started by watching
            a tutorial by freecodecamp:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/t6CBKf8K_Ac">
              https://youtu.be/t6CBKf8K_Ac</a
            >. This gave me a basic idea about how the grids work and after
            doing a project with the help of a youtube tutorial, I was confident
            that I can implement the tool in my website on my own.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Learn how to use flexbox.</h5>
          <p class="indented">
            Although I had learn’t to use CSS Grid, many youtubers stressed to
            learn both flexbox and CSS Grid as they have their own use cases.
            Considering that I learn’t flexbox as well and it payed off later as
            I found many applications for it too. To learn it, I followed the
            same principal as before starting with a tutorial. This time, I took
            a tutorial by Kevin Powell:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/u044iM9xsWU">
              https://youtu.be/u044iM9xsWU</a
            >. And then worked on a short project to make myself comfortable
            with flexbox. I also watched this amazing tutorial by Web Dev
            Simplified:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/fYq5PXgSsbE">
              https://youtu.be/fYq5PXgSsbE</a
            >. Which helped me revise my concepts and made me even more
            confident with the tool.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h5>Creating pop-ups from channels like coding snow</h5>
          <p class="indented">
            Developing a pop-up from scratch was turning out to be a very
            difficult task. I tried creating one but the product was not up to
            the mark. To get a better pop-up for my website, I turned over to
            youtube for help. There, I found this amazing tutorial by coding
            snow:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/MbSlUw3Dtk0">
              https://youtu.be/MbSlUw3Dtk0</a
            >. This helped me in making the pop-up that I currently have.

                The targeted minimalism. This is because I was able to provide a
                website that I find minimal enough and easy to navigate through.
                I also asked people including my family, relatives and friends
                about their opinion on the website and the response has been
                positive soo far.

                Responsiveness of the site for different screen sizes. Compared
                to what I delivered in the midterms, I think my skill to make
                the website more responsive has come quite far. When I did my
                survey on this matter and asked for people’s opinion, the
                response was positive again.

                Organising the code. I think that the new comment method that I
                added where each section of code has a dedicated summary to it
                is quite useful. I also used extensions such as prettier to make
                the code have a uniform and beautiful formatting.

                Addition of more useful features: use more javascript and add
                amazing features like night mode, article searching, etc. I was
                not able to add these features as I had a severe health
                condition and was on bed rest for almost 3 weeks. I aso had to
                work on 4 different modules,As a result, I was not able to
                invest proper time in my website project and had to compromise a
                little.

                Creating a more pleasing wireframe of the site. The current one
                is quite good but I think I can do much more.

                Working more on the accessibility part of the site. Again, I
                think enough has been done but their is a lot of scope for
                improvement.

          You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins
          or other code that you used to create your site. You should also
          reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of
          the scripts.
